# Bikesharing

## Project Overview
A key stakeholder in a bikesharing program would like to see a bike trip analysis. This analysis includes the following:
- the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Resources
